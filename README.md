A music discovery and sharing app.

Heard a new song that’s got you hooked ? Found a new cover version on Youtube that blew you mind ? Absolutely crushed it at the gym to your 
favorite workout track ? Survived your commute to work thanks to the cool new podcast you’re listening to ? Freaking out cause your favorite 
artist just dropped a hot new track ? Late for class cause your jam came on and you spent 10 extra minutes in the shower singing your lungs 
out to the song on repeat ? Tell us! Share and browse music content like songs, podcasts, live performance videos, cover versions, song lyrics, 
artist documentaries, etc. with new content brought to you every day by your friends! Tell us why you love that song, express using custom GIFS 
that capture exactly what a piece of music makes you feel. Create a profile, let your friends know who your music heroes are and share some of 
their top content. Explore all the music content being shared and discovered by your friends across Apple Music, Spotify and Youtube. 

Content is shared in 20 – 30 second audio/video clips, across native music streaming apps (Apple Music/Spotify/Youtube).
Add new content to your native streaming service(Apple Music/Spotify/Youtube) directly from the app.
Play all the shared content as a playlist in non-browsing mode.

Primary goals:

1. Better song recommendations.
2. Have a conversation about music.
3. Follow your friends, see what they are listening to. 
4. Discover new music and artists.
5. Find an audience to what you have to share as a Curator of music content – playlists, news, insight into music.
6. Connect with friends and other people you follow on the feelings that music brings out in you and day-to-day activities that would just not be the same without music.
7. Have full access to your entire native streaming library and playlists.

Follow and unfollow people.
Have one news feed where you see everything posted by your friends.
Scroll through the feed listening to all the posts shared by other people.

The Content :

1.	Audio  - Songs or podcasts from your native app.
2.	Video - Music videos, live performances, covers, artists interviews, documentary trailers, etc. from Youtube.
3.	Lyrics -  These posts will let you share lyrics from any song + the 20 – 30 sec clip of the song.
4.	Talk pieces – A user can record a short voice note saying something about a piece of music or music video which is then followed by the audio/video playing.
5.	Story/Article/News – Any music blog, article, song backstory, etc. 


A Post :

Very similar to an Instagram post in structure – instead of the photo you have album art, Youtube video or a black square with lyrics on it. 
There will be icons to indicate which native app is used by the person who uploaded the post.
There will be buttons for.
a.	Likes
b.	Downloads (Technically ‘additions’ to user libraries for songs and ‘full video watches’ for Youtube videos – basically a metric to quantify 
    that x number of users saw your post – liked it and went on to get the full song/watch the full video)
c.	Reshares
d.	Tags.

In the caption section you’ll have – either caption text OR a GIF that allows people to express why they like that song OR what they’re doing 
when they’re listening to the song/podcast (driving/coding/bathroom singing/dancing/chilling/talking a walk).

There will be a profile page where :

1.	You have all the posts you ever shared.
2.	Your bookmarks
3.	An ‘On my Mind’ section – where you can post that song that you’re currently ‘hooked to’/’have on repeat’/’can’t get out of your head’– Similar 
    format to a post – audio/video – accompanied by text or a GIF – which basically describes what you are feeling right now.
4.	Heroes – A section where you can list your all-time top 3 or 5 artists – you can also write like a small testimonial about them  - and list some 
    of their content that you think is their best work (songs, live performances, lyrics).
5.	Your native streaming service library – you can play and edit.

There will be an explore section – where you can search for content by :

1. Genre
2. Live or cover 
3. Activity
4. Emotion  - maybe v2.
5. By Heroes - search for content shared as Hero content by users on their profile - maybe v2.
6. By Artists.
7. Top trending.

Become a Curator:
For those users who actively search for new music, have a large knowledge base of artists, songs and performances and who like to recommend and share 
music – we have the role of ‘Curators’.

1. They create profiles like any other user. In the profile description the classify themselves into genres and sub categories of music using hashtags.
2. Other users can follow them and consume the content they share – which can be playlists, individual songs, artist stories, etc.


Other version 1 features :

1.	The app will be linked your native music app, so it will have access to your playlists and libraries and the entire Spotify/Apple Music/Youtube 
    content catalogue through your account , this enables uploading a post from within the app: 
    hit upload button - search song/video (by name/artist/album)– add text/GIF – post it.
2.	You can add songs that you discover on the app  - to your native music app library or playlists directly from the app.
3.	Play entire newsfeed as a playlist – for someone who doesn’t want to browse visually – just hit play – lock your phone and let the newsfeed play.
4.	You can bookmark posts that you like  - to download later.

Custom GIFs/Animojis:

We will have custom made GIFs that you could post with the song. These would be animated visuals that capture emotions/feelings that 
songs bring out in you. Like when a song 
-	gives you goosebumps.
-	makes you feel invincible. 
-	makes your heart soar.
-	makes your soul ache. 
-	makes you whole being cry. 
-	makes you feel super human. 
-	make you trip real hard.
-	makes you feel understood. 
-	has lyrics that you super relate to.
-	empowers you .
-	inspires you.
-	makes you dance.
-	leads you into a new genre/band you never thought you might be into.
etc.
They would also capture a lot of activities during which people listen to music
- Running
- Working out
- On a drive
- On their daily commute.
- Cooking.
- House chores.
- Bath/Shower.
- etc.

Using these, we’re trying to give user’s an easy way to express emotions and share a part of their lives
along with the music they enjoy. For a user that’s viewing this as a post, it brings a lot of context
and gives an extra nudge to listen to - that song their friend listening to right now on his/her commute to work
today. When users get likes for their posts, they not only have their music taste validated but also their
lifestyle and emotions validated in a way.
